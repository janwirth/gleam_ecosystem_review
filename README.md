# Ecosystem Reviews

Systematic evaluations of software ecosystems — sampled by the author's project needs, with the goal of becoming a reliable reference for CTOs and coding agents making tooling decisions.

## Vision

Picking a library shouldn't mean a weekend of GitHub archaeology. Every review here asks the same questions — *is it maintained? is it idiomatic? does it actually cover the feature you need?* — and answers them with reproducible, snapshot-dated evidence.

The target audience:

- **CTOs & tech leads** — need to justify tooling choices with more than a star count.
- **Coding agents** — need machine-readable, consistently-scored signal to recommend the right library on behalf of a human.

Coverage starts where the author's own projects demand answers, then widens outward. Topic requests and contributions welcome.

### Meta

- [Navigating software ecosystems](meta/navigating-ecosystems.md) — meta-review of the discovery toolkit itself: awesome lists, friends & experts, bundlephobia and friends, ossinsight, comparison pages, and how to combine them with this repo's structured-review approach.

### Upcoming

- Linters

## Method

Every review uses the same scoring scaffold: **stars, license, language-compat, maintenance, age, README maturity, idiomaticity**, plus category-specific dimensions (feature completeness, ease of use, output quality) where they apply.

- Data comes from public sources — GitHub / GitLab / Hex / package registries — captured on a named snapshot date.
- Disregarded repos are listed with reasons, so the triage is auditable.
- Scores combine into a leaderboard so authors can sanity-check their own metrics at a glance.

The full scoring formalization lives in [formalization.md](formalization.md). The first worked example is in the [Gleam web apps review](gleam/web-and-http/web-apps.md#research-method).
