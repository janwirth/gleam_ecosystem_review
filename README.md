# Ecosystem Reviews

Systematic evaluations of software ecosystems — sampled by the author's project needs, with the goal of becoming a reliable reference for CTOs and coding agents making tooling decisions.

## Vision

Picking a library shouldn't mean a weekend of GitHub archaeology. Every review here asks the same questions — *is it maintained? is it idiomatic? does it actually cover the feature you need?* — and answers them with reproducible, snapshot-dated evidence.

The target audience:

- **CTOs & tech leads** — need to justify tooling choices with more than a star count.
- **Coding agents** — need machine-readable, consistently-scored signal to recommend the right library on behalf of a human.

Coverage starts where the author's own projects demand answers, then widens outward. Topic requests and contributions welcome.

- [Choosing a web-presence stack](application-types/choosing-a-web-presence-stack.md) — the tier decision, from Wix to a custom app: five tiers (off-the-shelf builder · visual development platform · SSG + git CMS · framework + headless CMS · custom application), a pick-by-organizational-capacity grid, the "no technical staff doesn't mean Wix" case, and the break-even where plugin/add-on costs on off-the-shelf platforms stop being cheaper than building (editorial workflow and custom roles turn out to be the Enterprise-gated pair almost everywhere).
- [Website builders](application-types/website-builders.md) — ~60 hosted and self-hostable platforms across six families: mainstream all-in-one (Wix, Squarespace, Duda, GoDaddy, Hostinger, IONOS…), designer-first (Webflow, Framer, Webstudio), portfolio (Readymag, Cargo, Semplice, Pixpa…), WordPress + Elementor/Divi/Bricks/Beaver and the open-source corner, AI-first (Lovable, Bolt, v0, 10Web…), and Notion-as-CMS. Pricing-gotcha taxonomy, caps, lock-in/export table, SEO-by-construction, EAA accessibility, GDPR residency, Core Web Vitals. Plus ecommerce platforms and no-code app builders, reviewed to draw the boundary.

- [Formalization](practices/formalization.md) — the scoring rubric (stars, license, lang-compat, maintenance, age, README, idiomaticity, feature completeness, ease, output quality) and discovery pipeline used across all reviews.

### Industry watch — observing the broader ecosystem

Folder [`industry-watch/`](industry-watch/README.md).

- [Navigating software ecosystems](industry-watch/navigating-ecosystems.md) — meta-review of the discovery toolkit itself: awesome lists, friends & experts, bundlephobia, ossinsight, comparison pages, deps.dev.

Includes per-capability leaderboards and a "When to use what" decision table keyed by licence + runtime.

### Upcoming

- Linters

## Method

Every review uses the same scoring scaffold: **stars, license, language-compat, maintenance, age, README maturity, idiomaticity**, plus category-specific dimensions (feature completeness, ease of use, output quality) where they apply.

- Data comes from public sources — GitHub / GitLab / Hex / package registries — captured on a named snapshot date.
- Disregarded repos are listed with reasons, so the triage is auditable.
- Scores combine into a leaderboard so authors can sanity-check their own metrics at a glance.

The full scoring formalization lives in [`practices/formalization.md`](practices/formalization.md). The first worked example is in the [Gleam web apps review](gleam/web-and-http/web-apps.md#research-method). The agent-facing review process lives in [`workflows/`](workflows/README.md).

## Meta

[Meta-review](meta-review.md) — the repo reviewing itself: value, weaknesses, perspectives, methods, structure, target audience, and a punch list for automation (including which parts are worth splitting into standalone Gleam CLIs).
