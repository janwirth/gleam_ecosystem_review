## Summary

**Snapshot 2026-04-24.** The Gleam logging story splits cleanly on target: on BEAM, most libraries delegate to Erlang's OTP `logger`; on JS, everything falls back to `console.*`. **[logging](#logging)** (lpil) is the minimum-viable wrapper and the most widely-depended-on option. **[palabres](#palabres)** is the most polished dual-target structured logger. The rest is a long tail of experiments, some young, some abandoned.

A recurring pattern: Louis Pilfold (Gleam's creator) has filed issues against several libraries (`flash`, `woof`, `glimt`) pointing out they *print* rather than integrate with the BEAM `logger` — so log level filtering, `logger:add_handler`, and log forwarding don't work. Treat that as the defining line between "toy logger" and "production logger" on BEAM.

<a id="sink-callout"></a>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What "sink" means and why it's the load-bearing question on BEAM.** A *sink* is the final piece of code that actually writes log bytes somewhere — stdout, a file, OTP `logger`, etc. On BEAM the right sink is **OTP `logger`**, because routing through it gives you: runtime level filtering (`logger:set_module_level/2`), pluggable handlers (file rotation, syslog, journald, JSON formatters, log shippers like Datadog/Loki), shared output with library logs (`gleam_otp`, `ssl`, `inets`, Wisp middleware), per-process metadata (request IDs etc.), and OTP-native test capture/suppression. A sink that calls `io:format` straight to stdout skips all of that — your debug lines print no matter what config says, your shipper sees nothing, and your logs interleave with library logs in a mess.
>
> The gold-standard path on BEAM is: use [logging](#logging) for basic output, or [palabres](#palabres) if you need structured/JSON. Both route through OTP `logger` by default. [woof](#woof) (since v1.4) ships `woof.prod()` — a one-call preset that wires the OTP `logger` sink — so it's also gold-tier as long as you call it (the bare-`woof.info` quick-start path still bypasses OTP). [flash](#flash) currently has no opt-in escape and is the only library here that's unconditionally a stdout printer on BEAM ([upstream #4](https://github.com/larzconwell/flash/issues/4)).

> [!NOTE]
> On JS, OTP `logger` doesn't exist. Dual-target libraries fall back to `console.log` / `console.error` with a level prefix. That's a fine baseline, but don't expect parity with the BEAM side for things like handler routing — that's a platform gap, not a library gap.

### Erlang `logger` Adapters

Thin wrappers that route Gleam calls into Erlang's OTP `logger`. Level filtering, handler config, and log forwarding from dependencies all Just Work because OTP does the heavy lifting.

#### logging
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/logging) · [🥇](#leaderboard)

Minimal adapter to the OTP `logger`. Call `logging.configure()` once at startup; then `logging.log(Info, "…")` emits through the Erlang `logger` pipeline — handlers, formatters, levels, the lot. Authored by Louis Pilfold. Most downloaded logging package on hex; the implicit "canonical" BEAM choice for Gleam apps. 0 open issues at snapshot.

<a id="logging-compat"></a>
**Compat note:** `gleam.toml` pins `gleam_stdlib = "~> 0.34 or ~> 1.0"`. That's the `~>` pattern our rubric marks 🟥, but the `or ~> 1.0` disjunction widens it to cover all of Gleam 1.x. Marked 🟨 — functionally compatible, but worth re-evaluating when Gleam 2.0 ships.

```gleam
import logging.{Info}

pub fn main() {
  logging.configure()
  logging.log(Info, "Hello, Joe!")
}
```

#### glog
[repo](https://github.com/defgenx/glog)

Erlang `logger` wrapper with a fluent API deliberately modelled on Go's Logrus: attach typed fields to an entry, then call `infof`/`warnf` with a format string. Clever design, but last commit is April 2024 (~2 years dormant) and the README itself lists "documentation," "unit tests," and "configuration API" as TODO. 0 open issues but that's survivorship bias — nobody's filing against dead repos. The `~> 0.36` stdlib pin also excludes it from modern Gleam projects without an override.

### Structured Loggers (Dual-Target)

Pure-Gleam libraries that claim to run on both BEAM and JavaScript. All four ship JSON output and a field/context API; they diverge sharply on **how the BEAM side emits bytes** — the load-bearing question on this platform.

#### palabres
[repo](https://github.com/ghivert/palabres) · [🥇](#leaderboard)

"Opinionated logger for Gleam, targetting both BEAM and JS." Pipe-chain a message through `palabres.string/int/...` to attach structured fields, then `log`. On BEAM it goes through OTP `logger` (so `logger:add_handler`, `set_module_level`, etc. all work); on JS it falls back to `console`. Optional JSON output is first-class, and there's a dedicated `palabres_wisp` package that wires request logging into Wisp middleware. Requires OTP 27+ for the built-in `json` module. Most polished dual-target option at snapshot.

```gleam
import palabres
import palabres/options

pub fn main() {
  options.defaults()
  |> options.color(True)
  |> options.json(False)
  |> options.output(to: options.stdout())
  |> palabres.configure

  palabres.debug("Starting worker")
  |> palabres.string("worker_id", "wrk_3aa3")
  |> palabres.int("retries", 0)
  |> palabres.log
}
```

#### glogg
[repo](https://github.com/webermarci/glogg) · [🥈](#leaderboard)

"Named after the traditional Scandinavian mulled wine." Handler-based architecture: register one or more handlers with per-handler level filters and a hook pipeline for transforming events before they're written. The hook pipeline is the feature that distinguishes it — e.g., a hook that redacts `password` fields across every logger in the process. On BEAM, defers to lpil's `logging` package for the `logger` adapter. Only 1★ and a single open Renovate bot issue, but README is surprisingly thorough.

```gleam
import glogg
import glogg/level

pub fn main() {
  glogg.new()
  |> glogg.with_handler(glogg.stdout_handler(level.Info))
  |> glogg.with_hook(redact_password)
  |> glogg.setup

  glogg.info("user login")
  |> glogg.string("user_id", "usr_42")
  |> glogg.emit
}
```

#### flash
[repo](https://github.com/larzconwell/flash) · [🥈\*](#leaderboard)

"Gleam package enabling structured logging in both Erlang and JavaScript environments." Typed attributes, text and JSON writers, nested groups. On paper it ticks every structured-logging box.

<a id="flash-caveat"></a>
**Caveat ([#4](https://github.com/larzconwell/flash/issues/4)):** lpil filed an issue on 2025-08-08 titled *"Package is printing to the console instead of logging"* — on BEAM, flash writes to stdout via `io:format` rather than routing through OTP `logger`. That means OTP-level handlers, level filtering, and log forwarding don't see flash output. Unresolved at snapshot. Rules flash out of production BEAM use until fixed.

#### woof
[repo](https://github.com/lupodevelop/woof) · [🥇\*](#leaderboard)

"A straightforward logging library for Gleam. Dedicated to Echo, my dog." Eight log levels (Info..Emergency), typed fields that preserve Gleam types for pattern matching in tests, multi-sink dispatch, and instanced loggers for per-request scoped context. README is the most thorough of the four, and has the only built-in env-var level control (`set_level_from_env()`). Highest raw score in this review (8) — but see caveat below.

<a id="woof-caveat"></a>
**Caveat ([#6](https://github.com/lupodevelop/woof/issues/6)):** lpil filed *"implemented as a printing library instead of a logging library"* on 2026-03-15. The author responded in v1.4 (Apr 2026) by adding two one-call presets: `woof.dev()` (Debug level, text format, stdout — matches the pre-v1.4 default) and `woof.prod()` (Info level, JSON format, **OTP `logger` sink**). So the "fix" is now in the library: call `woof.prod()` once at startup and woof routes through OTP `logger` like `logging`/`palabres` do — every concern in the [main callout above](#sink-callout) is addressed.

What's still imperfect: if you write a quick-start `woof.info(...)` with no setup at all (the README's own opening example), you get the dev-style stdout path, not the production one. Beginners who copy that snippet into a deployed service will ship the broken behaviour. Cure: always end your `pub fn main()` setup block with `woof.prod()` for production builds.

```gleam
import woof

pub fn main() {
  // Production: OTP logger sink + JSON, one call.
  woof.prod()

  // — or, for explicit control —
  // woof.set_sinks([woof.beam_logger_sink])

  woof.info("cache hit", [woof.str("key", "user:42")])
}
```

### Structured Loggers (BEAM)

BEAM-only pure-Gleam loggers. Same shape as the dual-target group but narrower in scope.

#### glight
[repo](https://github.com/distrill/glight) · [🥇](#leaderboard)

"Shining light onto your gleam applications." Fluent API — `glight.logger() |> glight.with("user_id", "42") |> glight.info("login")` — with multiple transports (console, JSON file), colour output, eight log levels, and configurable JSON field names. Builds on lpil's `logging` for the OTP `logger` hop, so it plays nicely with the rest of the BEAM ecosystem. Zero open issues, active (last commit March 2026).

<a id="glight-compat"></a>
**Compat caveat:** `gleam_stdlib` upper bound is `< 1.0.0`. Formally a range (🟩), but it'll conflict with any project already on Gleam 1.x stdlib — widen to `< 2.0.0` locally.

```gleam
import glight

pub fn main() {
  glight.logger()
  |> glight.with("request_id", "req_3aa3")
  |> glight.with("user_id", "usr_42")
  |> glight.info("request handled")
}
```

#### glimt
[repo](https://github.com/JohnBjrk/glimt) · [🥉](#leaderboard)

"Get a glimpse (glimt in Swedish) of what is going on inside your software." The most architecturally ambitious of the pure-Gleam loggers: explicit separation between *dispatcher* (sync vs actor-based async) and *serializer* (human-readable, JSON, Erlang `logger` formatter). Levels from trace to fatal, contextual data binding, async dispatch via BEAM actors. Highest star count (31★) in this review — but last commit March 2024, stdlib pinned to `~> 0.36`, and the single open issue (from lpil in 2022) is still *"Consider using the BEAM logger."* Interesting reference design; not currently a maintained choice.

### Specialist Logs

Narrow-purpose libraries outside the general-purpose logger shape.

#### gbr_disk_log
[repo](https://github.com/gleam-br/gbr_disk_log) · [🥉](#leaderboard)

Type-safe Gleam wrapper around Erlang's `disk_log` — the OTP built-in for circular on-disk event persistence. Not a general logger; purpose-built for high-frequency, crash-safe event streams (audit trails, WALs, IoT telemetry). README is refreshingly honest about what it *isn't*: not human-readable, not distributed, single-node only. Zero open issues, active. Very young (~6 weeks), so 🟥 on age.

#### gclog
[repo](https://github.com/sam-kenney/gclog)

"A simple Google Cloud Platform compliant logging library for Gleam." Emits JSON matching GCP's LogEntry schema (severity, trace, span, source location, labels). Three usage tiers from plain string log to fully-decorated entry. Specialist output shape only worth using if you're shipping to Google Cloud Logging. 17 months dormant, 3 total commits, 1 open issue — low confidence.

<a id="viva_telemetry-note"></a>
#### viva_telemetry
[repo](https://github.com/gabrielmaialva33/viva_telemetry)

"Professional observability suite for Gleam: structured logging, metrics, and statistical benchmarking." Bundles three concerns into one package: RFC 5424 structured logging with sampling + lazy evaluation, counter/gauge/histogram metrics with Prometheus export, and statistical benchmarking (percentiles, confidence intervals).

**Access anomaly:** at snapshot, the `/commits/main` page returns "There isn't any commit history to show here," despite the repo being public and hex version 1.0.1 dated recently. Cannot assess maintenance recency or commit volume. Marked ⬜ on maintenance and age pending repo state clarification. Use at own risk until history is browsable.

#### redact
[repo](https://gitlab.com/ericcodes/gleam-redact)

"Prevent secrets from accidentally being logged." Hex package first released Sep 2025. Concept is useful — wrap sensitive values in a type whose `Inspect`/`String` representation is masked — but GitLab-hosted with a sparse repo page and no browsable README in this review pass. Worth knowing exists; evaluate properly if you need secret masking.

#### stacky
[repo](https://github.com/inoas/stacky)

"BEAM stack trace in Gleam." Captures the current BEAM stack trace as typed `StackFrame` records (module, function, arity, file, line). Pair it with any logger in this article to attach a stack trace to error-level events. 22 months dormant, so treat as stable-but-frozen rather than actively evolving.

### Related Work

- **[logging](#logging)** (lpil) — a dependency of several libraries above (`glogg`, `glight`); acts as the ecosystem's shared OTP-logger shim.
- **[gleam_otp](https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp)** — not a logger, but many of its supervisors/actors emit via OTP `logger`. Using `logging` or `palabres` means you pick up that output automatically.
- **[wisp](./web-and-http/web-apps.md#wisp)** — pairs naturally with `palabres_wisp` for HTTP request logging. Wisp's own helpers use OTP `logger` under the hood.

## Leaderboard

Thanks to everyone writing Gleam logging primitives — the ecosystem is young and every serious attempt teaches the rest of us something.

Every entry below is ranked by raw score (tie-break: maintenance recency, then README maturity). Caveats — like woof's default sink bypassing OTP `logger` — are flagged inline rather than used to drop a repo out of the ranking.

**🥇 Gold**
- **woof\*** ([lupodevelop](https://github.com/lupodevelop)) — Highest raw score in the review (8). Eight log levels, typed fields, instanced loggers, env-var level control. *\*The default `woof.info(...)` quick-start path prints to stdout; call `woof.prod()` (or `set_sinks([beam_logger_sink])`) once at startup to route through OTP `logger` — see [caveat](#woof-caveat).*
- **palabres** ([ghivert](https://github.com/ghivert)) — Best-in-class dual-target structured logger. Real OTP integration on BEAM, sensible JS fallback, Wisp middleware.
- **logging** ([lpil](https://github.com/lpil)) — The canonical OTP `logger` wrapper. Small, current, the default import in many other Gleam projects.
- **glight** ([distrill](https://github.com/distrill)) — Fluent BEAM logger layered on `logging`. Multi-transport, zero open issues.

**🥈 Silver**
- **glogg** ([webermarci](https://github.com/webermarci)) — Handler + hook pipeline design is genuinely useful for redaction/transform pipelines. Low stars, thorough README.
- **flash\*** ([larzconwell](https://github.com/larzconwell)) — Typed attributes, JSON writer, nested groups. *\*Same default-sink problem as woof but no opt-in escape hatch yet — see [caveat](#flash-caveat).*

**🥉 Bronze**
- **gbr_disk_log** ([gleam-br](https://github.com/gleam-br)) — Niche but necessary: the only typed wrapper for Erlang's `disk_log`. Young (~6 weeks at snapshot).
- **glimt** ([JohnBjrk](https://github.com/JohnBjrk)) — Most architecturally ambitious of the pure-Gleam loggers (dispatcher/serializer split). 2 years dormant, pinned to old stdlib.

**No award (dormant or unverifiable)**
- **glog** ([defgenx](https://github.com/defgenx)) — Logrus-inspired fluent fields. Dormant since April 2024.
- **gclog** ([sam-kenney](https://github.com/sam-kenney)) — GCP-compliant JSON entries. Specialist output, 17 months dormant.
- **viva_telemetry** ([gabrielmaialva33](https://github.com/gabrielmaialva33)) — Logs + metrics + benchmarks bundle. Commit history not browsable at snapshot — can't verify maintenance.

**\*Note on woof and flash:**

- **woof (raw score 8, position 1)** — highest in this review. The dimensional rubric rewards activity/README/compat, all of which woof nails. The asterisk is for an *integration* signal the rubric doesn't capture: a "sink" is the piece of code that actually writes log bytes somewhere, and woof's bare quick-start (`woof.info("...")`) writes straight to stdout (`io:format`) instead of handing the line to OTP `logger`. That breaks `logger:set_module_level/2`, OTP file/syslog/JSON handlers, log shippers, and log co-mingling with `gleam_otp`/`ssl`/Wisp output. **Woof v1.4 (Apr 2026) shipped a fix:** call `woof.prod()` once at startup and you get OTP `logger` sink + JSON in one line. So as long as you don't deploy the bare quick-start example, woof is production-grade. Pending [upstream issue #6](https://github.com/lupodevelop/woof/issues/6) making `woof.prod()` (or equivalent) the default, woof keeps its #1 ranking with this asterisk.
- **flash (raw score 6, position 3)** — same default-sink-bypassing-OTP problem as woof, but without the opt-in escape. Until [upstream issue #4](https://github.com/larzconwell/flash/issues/4) lands, flash on BEAM is a pretty stdout printer rather than a logger.

**By target:** ☎️ BEAM **11** · 📜 JS **5** (palabres, glogg, flash, woof, gclog; redact is pure Gleam but its practical use is pre-logger sanitization on either target).
