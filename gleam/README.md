# Gleam Ecosystem Reviews

Snapshot-dated evaluations of the [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) library landscape — what's maintained, what's idiomatic, and what actually covers the feature you need. Each article scores repos against the same scaffold (stars, license, language-compat, maintenance, age, README maturity, idiomaticity) plus category-specific dimensions, with disregarded repos listed for auditability.

For the full scoring formalization see [../formalization.md](../formalization.md); the review process is documented in [../workflows/REVIEW_METHODOLOGY.md](../workflows/REVIEW_METHODOLOGY.md). Back to the top-level index: [../README.md](../README.md).

## Articles

### Web & HTTP

- [Web apps](web-and-http/web-apps.md) — full-stack, server frameworks, HTTP servers, frontend, dev tools, RPC. 15 repos reviewed.
- [HTTP clients](web-and-http/http-clients.md) — making outbound HTTP requests.
- [Hot reloading](web-and-http/hot-reloading.md) — BEAM module swap, browser live reload, JS dev servers, file watcher primitives.
- [UI development](web-and-http/ui-development.md) — component libraries, layout primitives, icon sets, drag-and-drop kits, animations, and form helpers above the Lustre / redraw frontend choice.
- [Lustre server components](web-and-http/lustre-server-components.md) — guided tour through the official Lustre server-component examples (init / update / view running on the BEAM, DOM patches over WebSocket).
- [Tailwind](web-and-http/tailwind.md) — Gleam-specific Tailwind integrations, standalone CLI wrappers, class utilities, and component kits.

### Testing

- [Testing libraries](testing/general-testing.md) — gleeunit, dream_test, property testing, snapshot, assertions. 17 repos reviewed.
- [Browser automation](testing/browser-automation.md) — CDP clients, E2E frameworks, integration test infra.

### Other

- [Parsers & generators](parsers-and-generators/README.md) — split into [parse](parsers-and-generators/parse.md) (combinators, format parsers, HTML, glance/oas), [decode](parsers-and-generators/decode.md) (JSON / CBOR / MsgPack / BSON / Protobuf runtime), [generate](parsers-and-generators/generate.md) (gleamgen, trick, SQL→Gleam, OpenAPI→Gleam), and [serialize](parsers-and-generators/serialize.md) (encoders + Gleam→OpenAPI gap).
- [Subprocesses](subprocesses.md) — shelling out, streaming stdio, process control.
- [Syntax highlighting](syntax-highlighting.md) — per-language lexers, multi-language grammars, tree-sitter NIFs. 6 repos reviewed.
- [Databases](databases.md) — PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL drivers, query builders, codegen, migrations, framework-bundled DB. 9 repos reviewed (+ 4 disregarded).
- [Logging](logging.md) — OTP `logger` adapters, structured dual-target loggers, specialist sinks. 11 repos reviewed.

- [Email](email.md) — SMTP clients, transactional email vendor wrappers, HTML email composition, and the inbound / IMAP gap.
- [Mobile apps](mobile-apps.md) — Gleam has no native mobile target; the realistic 2026 paths all compile to JS then plug into a shell (Capacitor, Tauri Mobile, RN-as-logic-only, PWA, bare WebView). 5 paths scored. Cross-links to [../mobile/building-mobile-apps.md](../mobile/building-mobile-apps.md) for shell internals.
- [Guides & learning resources](guides.md) — Language Tour, Writing Gleam guide, Cheatsheets, Exercism, CodeCrafters, awesome-gleam, framework-shipped guides (Lustre, Wisp), YouTube talks, community blog series, newsletter, Discord. 15 resources scored. Honest about the no-book / no-paid-course gap.
