# Code generators in Gleam

Build-time tools that take an input artifact (Gleam source, SQL, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, etc.) and **emit Gleam source code**. Two shapes:

1. **Gleam → Gleam** — a Gleam DSL describes the code you want and the tool prints it. ([gleamgen](#gleamgen), [glue](#glue), [derived](#derived), [gserde](#gserde), [json_typedef](#json_typedef), [trick](#trick).)
2. **X → Gleam** — an external schema or query (SQL, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL, MCP) drives the codegen. ([squirrel](../databases.md#squirrel-), [parrot](#parrot), [marmot](#marmot), [sqlode](../databases.md#sqlode-), [oaspec](#oaspec), [gilly](#gilly), [oas_generator](#oas_generator), [aide_generator](#aide_generator), [embeds](#embeds), [squall](#squall).)

For runtime parsing of grammars, see [parse.md](parse.md). For the missing **Gleam → spec** direction (code-first OpenAPI), see [serialize.md](serialize.md#gleam--openapi-code-first-spec-generation).

## Summary

**Snapshot 2026-04-26.** Code generation is one of the more active corners of the Gleam ecosystem. The biggest, most-actively-developed slice is X→Gleam (SQL and OpenAPI codegen).

| Slice | Tools |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The reverse direction — **Gleam → spec** (e.g. mist/wisp routes → OpenAPI document) is **not covered by any package** as of snapshot. See [serialize.md](serialize.md#gleam--openapi-code-first-spec-generation) for the structural reason and workarounds.

## Gleam → Gleam generators

Libraries that **emit Gleam code** from Gleam — typically called by build scripts or other codegen tools.

Pick: **gleamgen** for the most-mature DSL with phantom-type guarantees. **trick** if you want elm-codegen ergonomics and don't mind a git dependency. **glue** if you only need the canned `compare`/`list_variants` derivers. **derived** if you want a marker-based round-tripper. **gserde** for opinionated JSON encode/decode emission. **json_typedef** when you have an RFC 8927 schema as the source-of-truth.

### gleamgen
[repo](https://github.com/Brewingweasel/gleamgen)

"A package for generating clean, type-checked, and formatted Gleam code!" Phantom-typed builder API — the type system enforces that the generated code typechecks. Removes unused imports, inlines functions, simplifies blocks. Foundational dependency for several other generators in the ecosystem.

### trick
[repo](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks/trick) · [docs](https://gearsco.de/trick/)

"A code generation library for Gleam, based on [elm-codegen](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-codegen)." By GearsDatapacks (Surya Rose). Builder API: declare constants, functions, parameters, variables, expressions, and the library prints valid Gleam to a string. Type-checked at the API level.

```gleam
import trick

pub fn main() {
  let pi = trick.constant("pi", trick.float(3.14))

  let radius = trick.parameter("radius", trick.float_type())
  let area = trick.function("circle_area", [radius], fn(radius) {
    trick.expression(
      trick.multiply_float(
        trick.variable(pi),
        trick.multiply_float(trick.variable(radius), trick.variable(radius)),
      ),
    )
  })

  trick.module([pi, area]) |> trick.to_string |> echo
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **trick vs gleamgen** — both are typed Gleam-emitting Gleam. `gleamgen` is published, established, and the foundational dependency for several downstream tools; `trick` is newer, elm-codegen-shaped, and currently git-only. Pick `gleamgen` for production today; pick `trick` if its API resonates with your team or if you want elm-codegen ergonomics. Watch trick for a Hex release.

### glue
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/glue)

"A package for generating functions from your Gleam code!" Built-in derivers: `compare` (orderings for custom types) and `list_variants` (list-of-all-variants for sum types). Reads existing Gleam source via [glance](parse.md#glance), inserts generated functions. By Louis Pilfold. Last commit 2024-12-08 — usable but not actively-developed.

### derived
[repo](https://github.com/dusty-phillips/derived)

"The gleam code generator's code generator." Marker-based: write `!derived(...)` directives in your Gleam source, run `derived`, and the tool inserts generated code at protected markers (round-trip safe). For building custom serialisation, validation, or documentation derivers. Last commit 2025-08-03.

### gserde
[repo](https://github.com/cdaringe/gserde)

"gleam codegen for serialization and deserialization." Generates JSON encode/decode functions for custom types. README declares **alpha** quality. Last commit 2025-12-13. Useful for prototyping; for production, prefer hand-written `gleam_json` decoders or the schema-first [json_typedef](#json_typedef).

### json_typedef
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/json-typedef)

"Work with JSON using a schema! RFC8927." JSON Type Definition (RFC 8927) — a JSON schema standard simpler than JSON Schema itself. Decodes a TypeDef document into Gleam, then generates encoders/decoders. By Louis Pilfold. 51★, last commit 2025-04-27, v1.1.3.

## SQL → Gleam

Cross-link: [../databases.md → SQL Code Generators](../databases.md#sql-code-generators) covers these in depth, with a comparison table for **squirrel vs sqlode**. Quick map:

| Tool | Dialects | Style | Stars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [squirrel](../databases.md#squirrel-) 🐘 | PostgreSQL 16+ | `.sql` files → typed Gleam decoders | 633★ | Established, FOSDEM-talked, tight pog integration |
| [parrot](#parrot) 🐘🪶🐬 | PostgreSQL · SQLite · MySQL | sqlc plugin → typed Gleam | 206★ | sqlc-backed (renamed from `sqlc-gen-gleam`) |
| [sqlode](../databases.md#sqlode-) 🐘🪶🐬 | PostgreSQL · SQLite · MySQL 8 | sqlc-style schema + queries → typed Gleam | 3★ | Brand new (Apr 2026), driver-agnostic at codegen |
| [marmot](#marmot) 🪶 | SQLite | `.sql` files → typed functions | 2★ | Inspired by squirrel, SQLite-only |

### parrot
[repo](https://github.com/daniellionel01/parrot) (renamed from `sqlc-gen-gleam`)

"🦜 type-safe SQL in gleam." A sqlc plugin: leverages sqlc's mature SQL parser/codegen pipeline and emits Gleam. Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Auto-downloads the sqlc binary; processes `src/sql/` files; outputs a unified `sql.gleam` module. README explicitly credits sqlc: *"Most of the heavy lifting features are provided by / built into sqlc, I do not aim to take credit for them."* Different from squirrel (which has its own PostgreSQL parser) and from [sqlode](../databases.md#sqlode-) (which writes its own multi-dialect codegen).

## OpenAPI → Gleam

Three tools cover this corner. Both [oaspec](#oaspec) and [gilly](#gilly) are very young (Apr 2026) but ship usable code today; [oas_generator](#oas_generator) is older, built on [oas](parse.md#oas).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both **oaspec** and **gilly** are days-to-weeks old at snapshot. They move fast — every PR in both repos was merged within hours of opening. Neither has a community track record yet. Pin a version.

> [!NOTE]
> Generated code is plain Gleam built on `gleam/http` types, so it composes with the rest of the ecosystem (e.g. [server frameworks](../web-and-http/web-apps.md#server-frameworks), [HTTP clients](../web-and-http/http-clients.md)). The generators themselves run on BEAM (oaspec/gilly) or are dual-target (oas_generator).

### oaspec
[repo](https://github.com/nao1215/oaspec)

"Generate strongly typed Gleam server stubs and client SDK from OpenAPI 3.x specifications." Wide coverage of the OpenAPI features that show up in real specs: `$ref`, `allOf`/`oneOf`/`anyOf`, `deepObject` query params, form and multipart bodies, all four major security scheme families. Capability boundaries are listed in the README and enforced at validation time — unsupported keywords (`prefixItems`, `not`, `unevaluatedProperties`, etc.) fail fast instead of producing broken code. Backed by 624 unit tests, 40 integration compile tests, 182 fixtures (94 OSS-derived). Distributed as an Erlang escript binary; also usable as a Gleam library with a pure pipeline (`parse → normalize → resolve → capability check → hoist → dedup → validate → codegen`).

CLI:
```sh
oaspec init
# edit oaspec.yaml: input, package, mode (server | client | both)
oaspec generate --config=oaspec.yaml
```

Output layout:
```text
gen/my_api/        types, decode, encode, request_types, response_types,
                   middleware, guards, handlers, router
gen_client/my_api/ types, decode, encode, request_types, response_types,
                   middleware, guards, client
```

Generated client signature:
```gleam
pub type Pet {
  Pet(id: Int, name: String, status: PetStatus, tag: Option(String))
}

pub type PetStatus {
  PetStatusAvailable
  PetStatusPending
  PetStatusSold
}

pub fn create_pet(config: ClientConfig, body: types.CreatePetRequest)
  -> Result(response_types.CreatePetResponse, ClientError)
```

CI drift check:
```sh
oaspec generate --config=oaspec.yaml --check --fail-on-warnings
```

### gilly
[repo](https://github.com/cyclimse/gilly)

"Generate Gleam SDKs from OpenAPI specifications." Client-only scope, inspired by [squirrel](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel) (Postgres codegen) and [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen) (Go). Builder-pattern request constructors, snapshot-tested with [birdie](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/birdie). README is upfront about scope: "many features from the OpenAPI specification are not yet supported"; generated code may break between releases. Ships a real-world Scaleway Containers example (~80 lines) that creates a serverless namespace, polls it to ready, and deploys an nginx container — useful as a reference for how the generated builder API composes with `gleam/httpc`.

CLI:
```sh
gleam add gilly --dev
gleam run -m gilly -- openapi.json --output src/my_api.gleam
```

Flags worth knowing:
- `--optionality {RequiredOnly | NullableOnly | RequiredAndNullable}` — how to decide which fields are `Option(_)` (default `RequiredOnly`)
- `--optional-query-params` — force all query params optional regardless of spec
- `--indent N` — spaces per indent level (default 2)

Generated client usage (Scaleway example, abridged):
```gleam
let api_client =
  client.new(send_fn, region: region, project_id: project_id)

let assert Ok(namespace) =
  client.new_create_namespace_request(
    name: "gilly-example",
    activate_vpc_integration: True,
    secret_environment_variables: [],
    tags: ["example", "gilly"],
  )
  |> client.create_namespace(api_client)
```

The `send_fn` is yours — gilly stays out of HTTP transport. Plug in `gleam/httpc`, `gleam/hackney`, or anything that round-trips `gleam/http` types.

### oas_generator
[repo](https://github.com/crowdhailer/oas_generator)

"Generate HTTP clients from Open API specs." Older entrant in the OpenAPI corner, built on top of the [oas](parse.md#oas) parser library. Supports both backend (`gleam/httpc`) and frontend (`gleam/fetch`) — making it the dual-target choice when oaspec/gilly's BEAM-only output won't fit. 25★, last commit 2026-04-16. Same author as `oas`.

## JSON Schema → Gleam

Cross-reference: [json_typedef](#json_typedef) is the schema-first JSON codegen entry, listed under [Gleam → Gleam generators](#gleam--gleam-generators) above (because it both parses the schema and emits the Gleam — making it both an "other-language parser" and a "Gleam generator" in one package).

For runtime JSON-Schema *validation* (without codegen), see [decode.md](decode.md#json-schema-json-patch-json-rpc) — [castor](decode.md#castor), [jscheam](decode.md#jscheam), [sextant](decode.md#sextant).

## Other → Gleam

### squall
[repo](https://github.com/bigmoves/squall)

"Type-safe GraphQL client generator." Generates Gleam client code from GraphQL schemas + queries. Out of scope for in-depth review at this snapshot; warrants a dedicated GraphQL article when the corner grows.

### aide_generator
[repo](https://github.com/crowdhailer/aide_generator)

"Generate encoders and decoders for MCP tools." Same author as `oas`/`oas_generator`. Useful for building MCP servers in Gleam where tool schemas are the source-of-truth.

### embeds
[repo](https://github.com/arkandos/gleam-embeds)

"Generate Gleam modules based on static assets." Bake files (HTML, CSS, images, anything) into compiled Gleam modules at build time. Adjacent to codegen — emits Gleam constants holding asset bytes rather than functional code.

### gRPC / Protobuf codegen

**Gap.** No published Gleam package emits Gleam code from `.proto` definitions, and no Gleam gRPC server framework exists. **Workaround:** generate Erlang stubs with `protoc` + `grpcbox` and call them from Gleam. Runtime-only Protobuf coverage exists via [protozoa](decode.md#protozoa).

## Cross-language framing

How Gleam's build-time codegen story compares.

| Language | Build-time codegen story | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gleam** | Explicit codegen tools that emit `.gleam` files; no macros, no compiler plugins. Build-script driven (`gleam run -m <tool>`), output committed to repo. | Outputs are auditable and grep-able. Requires running the tool whenever the input changes — CI drift check needed (e.g. [oaspec --check](#oaspec)). |
| **Rust** | Procedural macros (`#[derive(...)]`) and `build.rs`. Macros expand at compile time, output not visible by default. | Zero runtime overhead, terse source. Generated code invisible without `cargo expand`. |
| **OCaml** | PPX rewriters (preprocessor extensions) — `[@@deriving show, eq]`. | Similar to Rust macros; output via `dune describe`. |
| **TypeScript** | Code generators that emit `.ts` files (graphql-codegen, openapi-typescript, prisma generate). Pattern is **identical** to Gleam's — committed, build-step driven, drift-checkable in CI. | TypeScript is the closest analogue ergonomically. The Gleam ecosystem is converging on the same conventions. |
| **Go** | `go:generate` directives + `go generate` — emits committed `.go` files. Same pattern as Gleam. | Excellent for codegen; less common than struct tags for de/serialization. |
| **Java** | Annotation processors (`@Generated`); Lombok-style transformations. | Generated code merged into compile units, often not committed. |
| **Elm** | [elm-codegen](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-codegen) is the reference for typed-builder Gleam-codegen — explicitly inspires [trick](#trick) (and indirectly the gleamgen design space). | Explicit, typed, library-driven; Elm has no macros either. |

The Gleam codegen story sits closest to **TypeScript** and **Go**: emit-and-commit, build-step driven, no compiler magic. This is a deliberate consequence of Gleam having [no macros](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/1767) and no runtime reflection — the only way to do "derive" is to **literally write the Gleam source**.

The same constraint is what makes the **Gleam → spec** direction (e.g. handler types → OpenAPI) hard: there is no inspection mechanism short of parsing the source via [glance](parse.md#glance). See [serialize.md](serialize.md#gleam--openapi-code-first-spec-generation) for the full discussion.

### Honorable mentions

- **[squirrel](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel)** — the established SQL→Gleam codegen, FOSDEM-talked, 633★. The reference implementation other tools cite.
- **[parrot](https://github.com/daniellionel01/parrot)** — sqlc-backed, multi-DB, 206★. Renamed from `sqlc-gen-gleam`.
- **[oaspec](https://github.com/nao1215/oaspec)** — wide OpenAPI coverage out of the gate, capability boundaries documented, server *and* client.
- **[gilly](https://github.com/cyclimse/gilly)** — tight scope, builder-pattern API, snapshot-tested, real-world Scaleway example.
- **[gleamgen](https://github.com/Brewingweasel/gleamgen)** — phantom-typed builder API, foundational dependency for downstream codegen tools.
- **[trick](https://github.com/GearsDatapacks/trick)** — elm-codegen-shaped builder; pre-Hex but the developer-experience peer of gleamgen.
