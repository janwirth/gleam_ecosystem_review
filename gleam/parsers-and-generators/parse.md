# Parsers in Gleam

Runtime translation from text (or token stream) into a typed Gleam value. Three sub-shapes: parser combinators, format-specific parsers, and parsers for **other languages** consumed inside Gleam (`glance` for Gleam source, `oas` for OpenAPI specs).

For build-time codegen that consumes these parser outputs, see [generate.md](generate.md). For wire-format decoders where the grammar is fixed and trivial (JSON, CBOR), see [decode.md](decode.md).

Format parsers: [tom](#tom), [jot](#jot), [gsv](#gsv), [gleam_xmlm](#gleam_xmlm), [kirala_markdown](#kirala_markdown), [cel-gleam](#cel-gleam). HTML: [presentable_soup](#presentable_soup), [htmgrrrl](#htmgrrrl), [javascript_dom_parser](#javascript_dom_parser).

## Parser combinator toolkits

Primitives (`many`, `sep`, `between`, etc.) for hand-rolling a parser. Pick by error-message quality, recent activity, and license preference.

Pick: **nibble** for the most-used choice (82★, used by [chomp](#chomp) as its base). **chomp** if you want better error messages and don't mind a fork. **atto** for robust combinators with custom-stream support. **party** for a small surface and recent activity.

### nibble
[repo](https://github.com/hayleigh-dot-dev/gleam-nibble)

"A lexer and parser combinator library inspired by `elm/parser`." Two-stage design: a traditional lexer produces tokens, then combinators consume them. Pure Gleam, dual-target. By Hayleigh Thompson (creator of [Lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)).

```gleam
import nibble
import nibble/lexer

pub fn main() {
  let tokens = lexer.run("3 + 4", my_lexer)
  let assert Ok(ast) = nibble.run(tokens, my_parser)
  echo ast
}
```

### chomp
[repo](https://github.com/MystPi/chomp)

"A fork of nibble that does some things differently." Removes "error dead ends" and adds custom error types. Same lexer + combinator shape. Stale-ish (last commit Dec 2024) but stable.

### atto
[repo](https://github.com/ieeemma/atto)

"Robust and extensible parser-combinators for Gleam." Combinator inventory (`many`, `sep`, `between`, choice with backtracking), beautiful error messages, custom-stream support, and contextual grammar capabilities. Active in 2025.

### party
[repo](https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/party)

"A little parser combinator library in Gleam." Small surface, recent stdlib upgrade (Apr 2026). README explicitly recommends [atto](#atto) for more advanced needs. **Note:** MPL-2.0 license is weak copyleft at the file level — flag for shops standardising on MIT/Apache.

## Data-format parsers

Pure-Gleam parsers for specific formats — drop-in replacements for hand-rolling.

### tom
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/tom)

"A pure Gleam TOML parser!" By Louis Pilfold. Provides `tom.parse()` plus typed getter helpers. 3 open issues at snapshot (notably TOML v1.1.0 support and dynamic decoding) — usable but not actively-developed.

```gleam
import tom

pub fn main() {
  let assert Ok(parsed) = tom.parse("name = \"alice\"\nage = 30\n")
  let assert Ok("alice") = tom.get_string(parsed, ["name"])
}
```

### jot
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/jot)

"A parser for Djot, a markdown-like language." Two outputs: AST (`jot.parse`) and HTML (`jot.to_html`). Covers headings, lists, links, code blocks, math, and text formatting. Active (last commit 2026-04-07, v11.0.0).

### gsv
[repo](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/gsv)

"A simple csv parser and serialiser for Gleam." `to_lists()` for nested-list output, `to_dicts()` for header-keyed records. Custom delimiter support. Active (last commit 2026-04-18, v5.1.0).

### gleam_xmlm
[repo](https://github.com/mooreryan/gleam_xmlm)

"A pull-based XML parser for the Gleam programming language." Inspired by OCaml's `xmlm`. Includes XML conformance tests, benchmarking, and Erlang profiling tooling. Dual-licensed Apache-2.0 / MIT.

### kirala_markdown
[repo](https://github.com/Yasuo-Higano/kirala_markdown)

Markdown parser + HTML renderer. Both Erlang and JavaScript targets. Stale (last commit 2024-01-09, "for gleam ver 0.33") — usable but unlikely to track recent stdlib changes.

### cel-gleam
[repo](https://github.com/JonasHedEng/cel-gleam)

A Gleam implementation of [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) — Google's "non-Turing complete language designed for simplicity, speed, safety, and portability." Provides lexer, parser, AST, and expression evaluator. Useful for embedding rule/policy DSLs in Gleam apps. Active (last commit 2026-04-24).

## HTML parsers

Three approaches, none of them overlapping.

| Tool | Approach | Target | Stars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [presentable_soup](#presentable_soup) | High-level: query, scrape, snapshot-test | ☎️ BEAM (htmerl) | 23★ · 🟨 | "Good for snapshot testing" |
| [htmgrrrl](#htmgrrrl) | Low-level SAX events | ☎️ BEAM (htmerl) | 14★ · 🟨 | Stale (last commit 2023-12-08) |
| [javascript_dom_parser](#javascript_dom_parser) | Bindings to browser `DOMParser` | 📜 JS only | 8★ · 🟥 | Stale (last commit 2024-04-07) |

### presentable_soup
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/presentable-soup)

"Efficient querying, scraping, and parsing of HTML. Good for snapshot testing too!" Built on the Erlang `htmerl` parser. Highest-level of the three: query elements, scrape multiple, integrate with [birdie](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/birdie) snapshots. Active (last commit 2026-02-05, v2.0.0).

### htmgrrrl
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/htmgrrrl)

"Gleam bindings to htmerl, the fast and memory efficient Erlang HTML SAX parser." Event-based — receive `start_element`, `end_element`, `characters`. Lower-level than presentable_soup; useful when you don't want a tree in memory. Last commit 2023-12-08 — unmaintained but stable bindings.

### javascript_dom_parser
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/javascript-dom-parser)

"Bindings to the JavaScript `DOMParser` API." JS target only — for Lustre/SSR or browser-side parsing. Last commit 2024-04-07.

## String-slicing primitives

### splitter
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/splitter)

"Efficiently slice prefixes from strings. Good for parsers!" Below the combinator level — used as a dependency by several syntax-highlighter lexers (just, pearl, tear). 18★, last commit 2025-11-18, 0 open issues.

## Other-language parsers

Gleam libraries that parse the source/structure of **other** languages.

| Tool | Parses | Stars | Latest commit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [glance](#glance) | Gleam source code | 80★ · 🟥 | 2025-10-21 | Permissive parser, accepts code the compiler rejects |
| [oas](#oas) | OpenAPI 3.x specs (+ JSON Schema) | 15★ · 🟨 | 2026-04-16 | Used as input for [oas_generator](generate.md#oas_generator) |
| [glance_printer](#glance_printer) | Re-emits glance AST as Gleam | ⬜ | — | Pretty printer for the glance AST |

> [!NOTE]
> **Per-language syntax-highlighting lexers** (Gleam, Erlang, Elixir, JavaScript) live in [../syntax-highlighting.md](../syntax-highlighting.md). They parse other languages too — the role-difference is "extract token stream for colourisation" vs "extract AST for analysis/codegen." If you want to highlight Gleam code, use [contour](../syntax-highlighting.md#contour); if you want to analyse Gleam code, use [glance](#glance).

### glance
[repo](https://github.com/lpil/glance)

"A Gleam source code parser, in Gleam!" Permissive — accepts some code the official compiler rejects, useful for refactoring tools and analysers. By Louis Pilfold. Active (last commit 2025-10-21, v6.0.0).

```gleam
import glance

pub fn main() {
  let code = "
    pub type Cardinal {
      North
      East
      South
      West
    }
  "
  let assert Ok(parsed) = glance.module(code)
  echo parsed.custom_types
}
```

Used as a dependency by [crowdhailer/oas_generator](generate.md#oas_generator), [dusty-phillips/derived](generate.md#derived), and others doing source-level codegen.

### glance_printer
[repo](https://github.com/bcpeinhardt/glance_printer)

"A pretty printer for the glance AST." Companion to [glance](#glance) — pairs the parser with a re-emitter, closing the source → AST → source loop required for refactor tools.

### oas
[repo](https://github.com/crowdhailer/oas)

"Work with Open API Specs (previously swagger) and JSON Schema." Decodes OpenAPI 3.x documents into Gleam types (paths, components, operations). Used as input by [oas_generator](generate.md#oas_generator). Apache-2.0. 0 open issues at snapshot. Note: gleam.toml has `target = "javascript"` — JS-first, but parsing is platform-agnostic.
