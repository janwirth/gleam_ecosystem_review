## Summary

Snapshot: **2026-04-20**.

"Hot reload" means different things on each target. On BEAM it's real [hot code swapping](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/code_loading.html) — the running VM swaps a module's bytecode under long-lived processes without dropping state. On JavaScript it's [Vite](https://vite.dev/)/[Bun](https://bun.sh/)-style HMR: the bundler replaces modules in the browser and the framework re-renders.

Gleam has separate tools for each and no single cross-target answer — the mechanisms are too different to unify.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No single tool covers both targets.** BEAM reloaders swap compiled `.beam` modules in the running VM; JS tools rebuild the bundle and push HMR patches to the browser. Pick per target; compose if your app has both.

> [!NOTE]
> Only `radiate` does actual BEAM hot code swap. `mist_reload` and `olive` add a browser refresh on top. `lustre_dev_tools` is the blessed path for Lustre SPAs. Vite plugins give you stock Vite HMR if you prefer that stack.

> [!WARNING]
> **Lustre server components are a blind spot.** Server components run on BEAM and stream DOM patches to a 10 kB browser runtime over WebSocket — a different reload path from either SPA HMR or server-HTML refresh. **No reviewed tool documents a server-component dev loop.** The BEAM reloaders (`radiate`, `mist_reload`) fit in principle: swap the component module, reconnect the WebSocket on browser refresh. JS bundler tools (`vite-gleam`, `vite-plugin-gleam`) don't fit — server component code never ships to JS. See the `Lustre server components` row in each table for per-tool inference.

## Research Method

### Scoring Dimensions

Same rubric as [tools-for-building-web-apps.md](./tools-for-building-web-apps.md#scoring-dimensions). Recap:

- **Stars:** 🟩🟩 ≥200★, 🟩 ≥100★, 🟨 ≥10★, 🟥 <10★.
- **License:** 🟩 permissive (MIT/Apache/BSD), 🟥 viral or missing.
- **Gleam compat:** `gleam_stdlib` constraint format. 🟩 range (`>= X and < Y`), 🟥 `~>` pin. N/A for npm-only packages (no `gleam.toml`) — scored 🟩 (no resolver conflict possible).
- **Maintenance:** max(recency, responsiveness). 🟩🟩 <1 mo / <2 days / clean tracker, 🟩 <6 mo / <1 wk, 🟨 <1 yr / <1 mo, 🟥 older / ignored.
- **Age:** 🟩🟩 ≥3 yr, 🟩 ≥1 yr, 🟨 ≥3 mo, 🟥 <3 mo.
- **README maturity:** 🟩🟩 full guide + examples, 🟩 clear tagline + usage, 🟥 minimal.
- **Idiomaticity:** 🟩 typed/explicit, 🟥 magic directives or template extraction.

**Leaderboard:** 🟥 = −1, 🟨 = 0, 🟩 = 1, 🟩🟩 = 2. Sum of 7 dimensions, max 13.

**Non-scored criterion — Lustre server components support:** Whether the tool fits the [Lustre server components](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/lustre/server_component.html) dev loop — components run on BEAM and stream DOM patches to a ~10 kB browser runtime over WebSocket. **None of the reviewed tools document this explicitly**, so the value is inferred from the reload mechanism: 🟩 = mechanism fits (BEAM module reload picks up changed component code; a page refresh cleanly reconnects the server-component WebSocket), 🟥 = mechanism incompatible (tool bundles Gleam to JS; server components never ship to JS), ⬜ = no evidence either way. Confirm for your own project before relying on it.

### Discovery

Searches run on [Gleam packages registry](https://packages.gleam.run/) plus npm for Vite plugins. Terms: `reload`, `hot`, `live`, `watch`, `watcher`, `dev`, `hmr`, `vite`. Cross-checked via web search for "gleam hot reload" / "gleam HMR" / "gleam live reload".

### BEAM Module Reloaders

Watch sources, recompile changed modules, load the new bytecode into the running VM. Long-lived processes keep their state; code paths take effect immediately.

#### radiate
[repo](https://github.com/pta2002/gleam-radiate) · [🥉](#leaderboard)

"Hot reloading while in development for Gleam!" The only tool in the ecosystem that does real BEAM hot code swap: watches a directory via [filespy](#filespy), reruns `gleam build`, and reloads changed `.beam` modules into the running VM. Callback hook lets you run your own logic on reload (e.g. re-render UI). Gen-purpose — works for any BEAM-target app, not tied to a framework.

```gleam
import radiate

pub fn main() {
  let _ =
    radiate.new()
    |> radiate.add_dir("src")
    |> radiate.on_reload(fn(_) { io.println("reloaded") })
    |> radiate.start()

  // your normal app code here; it keeps running while code swaps underneath
}
```

### Server + Browser Live Reload (BEAM)

BEAM module reload + a WebSocket telling the browser to refresh. For full-stack apps where you want both sides updated on save.

| Lustre server components | 🟩 *(inferred — BEAM reload via radiate; page refresh reconnects server-component WebSocket)* | ⬜ *(mechanism fits but dormant; not recommended)* |

#### mist_reload
[repo](https://github.com/CrowdHailer/mist_reload) · [🥉](#leaderboard)

"Reload your mist web application in development, supports wisp etc." Wraps radiate and injects a tiny WebSocket client into served HTML so the browser refreshes the moment the BEAM module reloads. Install as dev dep. Low stars but actively maintained as of 2026-03 and fills a real gap (radiate reloads server code; this extends the loop to the browser).

```gleam
// Wrap your normal mist handler in mist_reload.handler during dev
import mist
import mist_reload

pub fn main() {
  let assert Ok(_) =
    fn(req) { your_handler(req) }
    |> mist_reload.handler
    |> mist.new
    |> mist.port(4000)
    |> mist.start
}
```

#### olive
[repo](https://github.com/fravan/olive)

"A gleam dev proxy to enable live reload and smoother DX." Dev proxy that sits in front of mist/wisp, watches files via `fs` + `simplifile`, recompiles, and pushes a reload to the browser. **The author's README states the project is no longer in active development** and warns of rough edges. Listed for completeness — prefer `mist_reload` for new projects.

### JS Dev Servers & Bundler Plugins

JS-target apps need browser HMR, not BEAM code swap. Two paths: Lustre's official tooling (opinionated, Bun-based, zero-config) or plug Gleam into your existing Vite pipeline.

| Criterion | [lustre_dev_tools](https://github.com/lustre-labs/dev-tools) [🥇](#leaderboard) | [vite-gleam](https://github.com/Enderchief/gleam-tools) [🥈](#leaderboard) | [vite-plugin-gleam](https://github.com/gleam-br/vite-plugin-gleam) |

| Lustre server components | ⬜ *(docs only describe SPA dev loop; server-component reload path is undocumented — verify before relying on it)* | 🟥 *(bundles Gleam → JS; server components run on BEAM and never ship to JS)* | 🟥 *(same: JS-only)* |

#### lustre_dev_tools
[repo](https://github.com/lustre-labs/dev-tools) · [🥇](#leaderboard)

Lustre's official CLI. Zero-config dev server, Bun-based bundling, TailwindCSS v4 auto-detection, browser live reload. Watches via [polly](#polly). CLI-driven — no Gleam API to integrate. Also covered in the main [tools-for-building-web-apps](./tools-for-building-web-apps.md#lustre_dev_tools) article; included here because live reload is its core dev-UX feature.

```sh
gleam add lustre_dev_tools --dev
gleam run -m lustre/dev start   # dev server + HMR-like reload
```

#### vite-gleam
[repo](https://github.com/Enderchief/gleam-tools) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-gleam))

Vite plugin that lets you `import` `.gleam` files directly from JS/TS, compiled via Gleam's `--target javascript`. HMR is whatever Vite gives you — module replacement with state preservation, full browser reload on unreplaceable changes. Part of the `gleam-tools` monorepo (which also ships a TS LSP plugin). For teams already on Vite/React/Svelte who want to mix in Gleam modules.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import gleam from "vite-gleam"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [gleam()],
})
```

#### vite-plugin-gleam
[repo](https://github.com/gleam-br/vite-plugin-gleam)

Newer, independently authored Vite plugin with different configuration surface. Zero traction yet (0★) but recent (last commit 2025-12-18). Listed so readers know both exist; prefer `vite-gleam` until this one accrues users.

### File Watcher Primitives

Not reload tools themselves — the OS-level file-event libraries that the reloaders build on. Included because if you're rolling your own dev tooling, these are the three picks.

| Criterion | [filespy](https://github.com/pta2002/gleam-filespy) | [watchexec](https://github.com/lpil/watchexec) | [polly](https://gitlab.com/arkandos/polly) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stars | 18★ · 🟨 | 5★ · 🟥 | ⬜ (GitLab) · 🟥 |
| License | Apache-2.0 · 🟩 | Apache-2.0 · 🟩 | ⬜ · 🟩 *(assumed permissive; verify before use)* |
| Target | ☎️ BEAM | ☎️ BEAM | ☎️ BEAM |
| Gleam compat | `>= 0.44 and < 2.0` · 🟩 | `>= 0.44 and < 2.0` · 🟩 | ⬜ · 🟩 |
| Maintenance | 🟨 (last 2025-08-13, ~8 mo) | 🟩🟩 (last 2026-02-02, v1.0.0, clean tracker) | 🟩 (used by lustre_dev_tools, kept current) |
| Age | ~2.5 years (first commit 2023-10-21) · 🟩 | ~2.7 months (first commit 2026-01-29) · 🟥 | ~2+ years · 🟩 |
| README maturity | 🟩 | 🟩 | 🟨 *(tagline, minimal)* |
| Idiomaticity | 🟩 | 🟩 | 🟩 |
| Lustre server components | 🟩 *(primitive; compose with radiate or your own reloader)* | 🟩 *(primitive; same)* | 🟩 *(primitive; same)* |

Mechanics:
- **filespy** — Erlang `fs` NIF (inotify/FSEvents/ReadDirectoryChangesW). Native events, zero polling cost. Powers radiate.
- **watchexec** — spawns the [`watchexec`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) CLI as an Erlang port. Cross-platform, needs the binary installed. lpil's, v1.0.0 just shipped.
- **polly** — pure-Gleam polling. No NIFs, no external binaries — costlier CPU, but works anywhere. Powers lustre_dev_tools' bundler hot reload.

#### filespy
Tagline: "Get notified of filesystem events in Gleam." Returns a stream of typed events.

```gleam
import filespy

pub fn main() {
  filespy.new()
  |> filespy.add_dir("src")
  |> filespy.set_handler(fn(path, event) {
    io.println("changed: " <> path)
  })
  |> filespy.start()
}
```

#### watchexec
Tagline: "Use watchexec as a cross-platform file event watcher on the BEAM!" Sidesteps NIF compilation by shelling out to the `watchexec` binary through an Erlang port.

#### polly
Polling-based watcher used by [lustre_dev_tools](#lustre_dev_tools). Lives on GitLab. Preferred when you can't rely on NIFs or external binaries (sandboxed CI, WASM-adjacent envs).

## Leaderboard
Every contribution is invaluable and appreciated.

Medals assigned strictly by score (ties share a medal). polly is listed but excluded from scoring (no reliable GitLab metrics).

**🥇 Gold**
- **lustre_dev_tools** ([hayleigh-dot-dev](https://github.com/hayleigh-dot-dev), [yoshi-monster](https://github.com/yoshi-monster)) — The blessed dev loop for Lustre SPAs: bundling, serving, and browser reload in one CLI.

**🥈 Silver**
- **vite-gleam** ([Enderchief](https://github.com/Enderchief)) — The bridge for teams already on Vite. Lets you drop `.gleam` files into a JS/TS Vite project and get stock Vite HMR.

**🥉 Bronze** (three-way tie)
- **radiate** ([pta2002](https://github.com/pta2002)) — The only real BEAM hot code swap in the Gleam ecosystem. Everything else that reloads server code stands on this.
- **filespy** ([pta2002](https://github.com/pta2002)) — The native file-event primitive radiate (and anything else on BEAM) builds on.
- **mist_reload** ([CrowdHailer](https://github.com/CrowdHailer)) — Small surface, real gap: extends radiate's server reload to the browser for mist/wisp apps. Low stars but actively maintained.
