## What is Gherkin?

**Gherkin** is a plain-text, line-oriented DSL for describing software behaviour in examples. A `.feature` file looks like this:

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping cart totals

  Scenario: Adding two items
    Given I have an empty cart
    When I add a "Widget" costing 10
    And I add a "Gadget" costing 5
    Then the total should be 15
```

Three properties make it interesting:

- **Business-readable.** Non-programmers can read (and often write) scenarios.
- **Executable.** Each `Given`/`When`/`Then` line is matched to a code block ("step definition") in a host language, which runs during the test suite.
- **Polyglot.** The same feature file can drive tests in Ruby, JS, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Rust, PHP, Elixir, etc. — because the parser and the runner are separate concerns.

Gherkin is the *specification language*. **Cucumber** is the family of runners that execute it. Together they implement **Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)** — the practice of writing specs first, discussing them with stakeholders, and then using them as the source of truth for the test suite.

## The BDD pipeline

Every Cucumber-family tool has the same three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  .feature file          │  ← Gherkin spec (plain text, business-owned)
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │ parsed by Gherkin parser
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  AST / message stream   │  ← Language-neutral intermediate representation
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │ matched against…
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Step definitions       │  ← Host-language glue code (Ruby/Python/JS/…)
│  (regex + lambda)       │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │ executed by…
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Test runner            │  ← Native test harness (RSpec/Jest/pytest/…)
└─────────────────────────┘
```

When you pick a BDD library for a language, you are really picking three things:

1. **A Gherkin parser** (usually the official `cucumber/gherkin` port for that language).
2. **A step-binding layer** (how regex/cucumber-expression matchers map to functions).
3. **A test runner** (standalone like `cucumber-js`, or integrated with an existing runner like `pytest-bdd`).

Some tools bundle all three (e.g. `cucumber-ruby`). Some only do parsing (e.g. `cucumber_gherkin` for Elixir). Some plug into an existing runner (e.g. `pytest-bdd`, `cabbage` → ExUnit, `dream_test` → its own + ExUnit-style).

### Notes per ecosystem

- **Ruby, JS, JVM, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET**: first-tier support. Active releases, daily-to-weekly commits, full docs, ecosystem plugins (reports, parallelism, IDE integration).
- **Reqnroll** is the successor to SpecFlow. SpecFlow's repos were *deleted* on 2025-01-01 after end-of-life; Reqnroll forked the codebase before shutdown and is now the canonical .NET BDD choice.
- **behave vs pytest-bdd**: Two Pythonic approaches. `behave` is a standalone runner faithful to Cucumber-Ruby; `pytest-bdd` is a plugin that reuses pytest fixtures, meaning you write fewer separate tools but give up some Gherkin features (e.g. tags are implemented as pytest markers). Both active.
- **cabbage** (Elixir) is the currently-active Elixir option. Compile-time translation of `.feature` files to ExUnit tests. Last commit 2025-03-14 (~13 months before snapshot) — healthy but not daily.
- **white-bread** (Elixir) is historically the best-known Elixir BDD tool but has been unmaintained since 2020-11-04 (5+ years). README notes it is "looking for maintainers." Do not pick for new projects.
- **dream_test** (Gleam) is the only Gleam-native BDD tool at snapshot — young (first PR 2025-12-01), single-org maintained, clean tracker (1 open issue), solid README. Usable but thin community track record.
- **Haskell**: `sol/cucumber-haskell` last touched 2014, 9 stars — effectively abandoned. `chuchu` and `abacate` on Hackage are similarly stale. Haskell BDD is thin — most Haskell teams use `hspec` + property tests instead.
- **Erlang**: no active Cucumber-ports found. Best path is Elixir interop (cabbage) from an Erlang project, or treat BDD as Elixir-layer tooling.

## The polyglot Gherkin parser

Separate from the runners, there is one **canonical Gherkin parser** that is ported to 12 languages and maintained in a single monorepo:

| Repo | [cucumber/gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin) |
| --- | --- |
| Stars | 323 · 🟩🟩 |
| Last commit | 2026-04-22 · 🟩🟩 |
| Open issues | 42 |
| License | MIT · 🟩 |
| Target languages | .NET, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Python, C, C++, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Dart |
| Not yet shipped | Rust (wishlisted), Elixir (shipped separately as [`cucumber_gherkin`](https://hex.pm/packages/cucumber_gherkin) v38, published by cukebot) |
| README maturity | 🟩🟩 (per-language install tables, i18n keyword list, contributor guide) |

All language ports are generated from a shared grammar definition and kept version-locked. That's why a `.feature` file behaves identically whether you run it through cucumber-ruby or cucumber-js.

Independent parsers exist but are niche:

- **[Ajwah/ex-gherkin](https://github.com/Ajwah/ex-gherkin)** — Elixir, 7★, "fully fledged" alternative to the cucumber org's Elixir port. Uses `yecc`. Niche.
- **[cabbage-ex/gherkin](https://github.com/cabbage-ex/gherkin)** — 16★, extracted from white-bread, used by the cabbage runner.
- **[stewartmatheson/gherkin](https://github.com/stewartmatheson/gherkin)** — Elixir, single-author pure parser.

If you only need to *parse* `.feature` files (e.g. to generate documentation, lint scenarios, or route to a custom runner), the official `cucumber/gherkin` port for your target language is the safe pick.

## Recommendation

Pick the canonical Cucumber-family tool for your host language. In the top-tier ecosystems (Ruby, JS, JVM, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET), the official port is actively maintained, widely deployed, and well-documented — there is no meaningful alternative to evaluate.

Decision heuristic:

1. **First-tier native port exists?** (Ruby / JS / JVM / Python / PHP / Go / Rust / .NET) → Use it. No further shopping needed.
2. **Only a second-tier native option?** (Elixir, Gleam) → Use it if the README is mature and maintenance is current; otherwise consider interop from a neighbouring language on the same runtime, or skip BDD.
3. **No active native tool?** (Erlang, Haskell, Clojure) → Either interop from a language that does have one, or use the idiomatic non-Gherkin testing style (hspec, clojure.test) with descriptive test names. Gherkin's business-readability payoff rarely justifies maintaining an adapter on a thin stack.
4. **Stakeholder readability is not a hard requirement?** → Skip BDD entirely. Most small/medium projects do fine with their ecosystem's default test runner and descriptive test names. Gherkin pays off when non-programmers write or review specs; without that, it's overhead.

For *parser-only* use cases (lint, docs, custom tooling), the official `cucumber/gherkin` port is the safe choice regardless of host language.

### Appendix: ecosystems outside the table

Covered briefly for completeness:

- **Swift / iOS**: `XCTest-Gherkin` (community port), plus `Cucumberish`. Lower traction than the top-tier ports.
- **Dart / Flutter**: `flutter_gherkin` (community, active). Part of the `cucumber/gherkin` polyglot parser's target list.
- **Scala**: wraps `cucumber-jvm` via `cucumber-scala`. No standalone tool worth tracking separately.
- **Clojure**: historically `lein-cucumber`; now largely abandoned. Most Clojure teams stick to `clojure.test` + generative testing.
